(node:15980) ExperimentalWarning: VM Modules is an experimental feature and might change at any time

(node:15980) [JEST-01] DeprecationWarning: 'currentlyRunningTest' property was accessed on [Object] after it was soft deleted
  Jest deletes objects that were set on the global scope between test files to reduce memory leaks.
  Currently it only "soft" deletes them and emits this warning if those objects were accessed after their deletion.
  In future versions of Jest, this behavior will change to "on", which will likely fail tests.
  You can change the behavior in your test configuration now to reduce memory usage.
